    <p class="p1">The Greenhouse gas And Air Pollutants Emissions System (GRA²PES) dataset at the GHG Center is an aggregated, regridded, monthly high-resolution (0.036 x 0.036°) data product with emissions of both greenhouse gases and air pollutants developed in a consistent framework. The dataset contains emissions over the contiguous United States covering major anthropogenic sectors, including energy, industrial fuel combustion and processes, commercial and residential combustion, oil and gas production, on-road and off-road transportation, etc.
        The Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO₂ (ODIAC) data product is a monthly high-resolution global data product of modeled fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions. A complex model incorporates and combines space-based nighttime light data and individual power plant emission/location profiles from the latest country fossil fuel CO₂ estimates (2000-2020) made by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) team at the Appalachian State University (CDIAC at AppState, Gilfillan et al. 2021, Hefner et al. 2022). The ODIAC estimated global spatial extent of fossil fuel CO₂ emissions is produced on a 1 km by 1 km grid that details variations in urban regions where emissions are most intense. The ODIAC CO₂ emission data is widely used by the international research community for applications such as CO₂ flux inversion, urban emission estimation, and observing system design experiments.
        Surface methane (CH₄) emissions are derived from atmospheric measurements of methane and its ¹³C carbon isotope content. Different sources of methane contain different ratios of the two stable isotopologues, ¹²CH₄ and ¹³CH₄. This makes normally indistinguishable collocated sources of methane, say from agriculture and oil and gas exploration, distinguishable. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) collects whole air samples from its global cooperative network of flasks (https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/about.html), which are then analyzed for methane and other trace gases.
